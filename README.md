- 👋 Hi, I’m Lou but do not suffer from @ religionisabrainmalfunction
- 👀 I’m using LosslessCut for my own Videos
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to store Videos taken by my INTERNAL Laptop cam Fujitsu FJ with Ispyx64 and MP4, rework and store it after cutting out unnecessary stuff. I
can ONLY use that primitive camera for room surveilance. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with someone who can simply tell me why only the sound is playing but not the usual Video that works on all other Videos I took using 
LosslessCut with another device and it works just perfect there!! It must be a very simple solution but I am too stupid to find it!
- 📫 How to reach me: religionisabrainmalfunction/religionisabrainmalfunction is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
